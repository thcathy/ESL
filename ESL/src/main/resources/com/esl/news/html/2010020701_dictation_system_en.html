<div><h3>Create your own dictation - Dictation System for Student / Parent / Teacher</h3>
<p>Due to heavy workload on our developer, Fun Fun Spell have been no functional updated for 3 months.
<br />Finally, we have created a new dictation system for the new start of 2010. 
<br />It is not an update to the existing dictation function only. It is a brand new system that you can save dictations and monitor your progress. Besides, client can work on dictations created by others.</p> 

<p>For tutors or parents, you can create a dictation and send the link to the students. By Fun Fun Spell, you can know who have done the dictation and the results they got. 
<br />All functions can be found from the new menu bar inside the "My dictation" page. Let's try now!</p>
