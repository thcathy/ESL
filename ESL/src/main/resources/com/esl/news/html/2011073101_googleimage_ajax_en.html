	<h1>Image for vocabulary and Faster loading in practice</h1>
	<p>When you doing practice, you will facing two differences.</p>
	<p>The first one is the image provided for every question in practice no matter in dictation or phonics practice. The images are provided by Google. Sometimes, if the first image do not suitable, you can simply click the 'next image' button to get more image for reference.</p>
	<img src="/ESL/images/news/2011072601_en.png" />
	<p>Another important change is the page loading during practice. We have adopt to Ajax technology so that you will not need to reload the whole page but the question only. This reduce much of the loading time during practice and the annoying page refresh.</p>
	<p>The page loading improvement already applied to most of the practice excluding dictation. We will adopt the change for all practice ASAP.</p>
