<h3>Important internal system upgrade</h3>
<p>FunFunSpell system have been upgraded internally. Although most of you cannot find anything different from this upgrade, it should improve the performance, reduce errors and development times for the future.</p>
<p>And we will keep providing a better site. Please keep on supporting us.</p>

<p><strong>The following are for those who are interested in programming. (Not for children, :-) and with English version only)</strong></p>

<p>The internal system of FunFunSpell have changing from using Java Server Faces (JSF) with JSP technology to JSF Facelets.
<br />We have spent over two week to change all the jsp to xhtml, the process is quite straight forward and created a few problems only.
<br />With Facelets, it reduced lot of overhead on creation and maintanance of web pages. And it should also increase the performance on view rendering.
<br />Facelets really simply the structure of pages with template and custom component. Both help us in maintanance a lot.
</p>
<p>We hope that facelets is a right choice to us as we only got one programmer for the site. And later on, we will study how JSF 2.0 can improve the development and functionality. ( However, we got a list of tasks to do before that T_T )</p>
