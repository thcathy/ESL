inputDesTitle=What is My Dictation?
inputDesTxt=Learning to spell is less important in speaking English. However, learning English as a kind of language must begin with words since words are the foundation of all kinds of language. Most students found dictating words are boring and time consuming. In My Dictation students are guided to make use of the relationship between pronunciation and letters combination to learn spelling words. It is interesting and efficient. Not believe? Try it yourself.
