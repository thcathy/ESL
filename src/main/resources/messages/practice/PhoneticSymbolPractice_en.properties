Most teachers and parents always tell their children to write the words several times when they try to help them to learn a word. The purpose to write the word several times is to remember the word as picture through the visual memory system. However, English words are built on the base of sound while Chinese characters are pictorial that built on the base of the composition of radicals and the lateral parts. The letters of an English word are similar to musical notes. Copy the notes but do not know how to turn them into sound is meaningless.
